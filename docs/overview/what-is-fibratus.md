# What is Fibratus?

[Fibratus](https://github.com/rabbitstack/fibratus) detects, protects, and eradicates advanced adversary tradecraft by scrutinizing
and asserting a wide spectrum of system events against a behavior-driven [rule engine](/filters/rules) and [YARA](/yara/introduction) memory scanner.

Events can also be shipped to a wide array of [output sinks](/outputs/introduction) or dumped to [capture](/captures/introduction) files for local inspection and forensics analysis. You can use [filaments](/filaments/introduction) to extend Fibratus with your own arsenal of tools and so leverage the power of the Python ecosystem.

In a nutshell, the Fibratus mantra is defined by the pillars of **realtime behavior detection**, **memory scanning**, and **forensics capabilities**.
