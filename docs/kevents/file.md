# File events

File events encompass a variety of file system related activities such as creating or opening directories/files/devices, writing or reading data, altering file metadata and so on.

#### CreateFile

The `CreateFile` event is triggered when the kernel serves create/open requests for files or I/O devices. The most commonly used I/O devices are as follows: file, file stream, directory, physical disk, volume, console buffer, tape drive, communications resource, mailslot, and pipe. `CreateFile` events have the following parameters:

- `file_object` is the file object pointer as seen from the kernel perspective. You can use this parameter to correlate file events.
- `file_name` represents the file/directory or device name (e.g. `C:\ProgramData\AVG\Antivirus\psi.db-journal`)
- `irp` is the I/O request packet value that identifies the file system activity.
- `operation` identifies the file system operation performed on the file or device:
  - `supersede` replaces the file if it already exists, otherwise creates a new file
  - `open` opens the file if it exists
  - `create` creates a new file or fails if the file already exists
  - `openif` opens the file if it already exists, otherwise creates a new file
  - `overwrite` opens and overwrites the file if it already exists
  - `overwriteif` opens and overwrites the file if it already exists, otherwise creates a new file
- `share_mask` specifies the sharing mode of the file or device, which can be read, write, both, delete, all of these, or none. This flag determines the permission granularity which enables a process to share a file or device while another process has the file or device open.
- `type` defines the file type. Possible values are `file`, `directory`, `pipe`, `console`, `mailslot`, `other`, `unknown`.

#### WriteFile and ReadFile

These events occur when a process writes data to a file or reads data from the file or I/O device. They contain the following parameters:

- `file_object` is the file object pointer as seen from the kernel perspective. You can use this parameter to correlate file events.
- `file_name` represents the file/directory or device name the data is written to or read from.
- `irp` is the I/O request packet value that identifies the file system activity.
- `io_size` specifies the number of bytes read or written.
- `offset` determines the offset in the file where the data is read or written.
- `type` defines the file type. Possible values are  `file`, `directory`, `pipe`, `console`, `mailslot`, `other`, `unknown`.


#### DeleteFile

Removes the file from the file system. This event contains the following parameters:

- `file_object` is the file object pointer as seen from the kernel perspective. You can use this parameter to correlate file events.
- `file_name` represents the file/directory that was removed
- `irp` is the I/O request packet value that identifies the file system activity.
- `type` defines the file type. Possible values are  `file`, `directory`, `pipe`, `mailslot`, `other`, `unknown`.

#### RenameFile

Renames the file or directory in the file system.

- `file_object` is the file object pointer as seen from the kernel perspective.
- `file_name` represents the file/directory that was renamed.
- `irp` is the I/O request packet value that identifies the file system activity.
- `type` defines the file type. Possible values are  `file`, `directory`, `other`, `unknown`.

#### CloseFile

Closes the handle to opened file. This event is excluded by default.

- `file_object` is the file object pointer as seen from the kernel perspective.
- `file_name` represents the file/directory that was closed.
- `irp` is the I/O request packet value that identifies the file system activity.
- `type` defines the file type. Possible values are  `file`, `directory`, `pipe`, `console`, `mailslot`, `other`, `unknown`.


#### SetFileInformation

Sets the file information for the file according to the file information class.

- `class` identifies the file information class. For example, the `Basic` information class means the process altered file timestamps or basic attributes. Refer to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ne-wdm-_file_information_class) link for a full list of the file information class enumerations.
- `file_object` is the file object pointer as seen from the kernel perspective.
- `file_name` represents the file whose information class was set.
- `irp` is the I/O request packet value that identifies the file system activity.
- `type` defines the file type. Possible values are `file`, `pipe`, `mailslot`, `other`, `unknown`.


#### EnumDirectory

The `EnumDirectory` event is triggered in response to directory enumeration requests.

- `dir` specifies the directory that was requested for enumeration.
- `file_name` is the pattern for directory enumeration.
- `class` identifies the requested directory enumeration class.
- `file_object` is the file object pointer as seen from the kernel perspective.
- `irp` is the I/O request packet value that identifies the file system activity.
