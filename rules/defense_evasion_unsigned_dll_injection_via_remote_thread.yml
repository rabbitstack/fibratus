name: Unsigned DLL injection via remote thread

description: |
  Identifies unsigned DLL injection via remote thread creation.
  Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses
  as well as possibly elevate privileges. DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address
  space of a separate live process.
