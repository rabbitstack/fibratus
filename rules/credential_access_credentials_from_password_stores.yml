- group: Credentials discovery from Windows Credential Manager through CLI tools
  description: |
    Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager
    by employing external tools such as VaultCmd that can be used to enumerate
    credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface.
    The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites,
    applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM
    or Kerberos in Credential Lockers.
