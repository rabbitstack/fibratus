- group: Credentials discovery from Windows Credential Manager through built-in tools
  description: |
    Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager
    by employing external tools such as VaultCmd that can be used to enumerate
    credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface.
    The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites,
    applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM
    or Kerberos in Credential Lockers. dversaries may also obtain credentials from credential backups.
    Credential backups and restorations may be performed by running rundll32.exe builtin binary.
