- group: Credentials access from Windows Credential Manager
  description: |
    Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.
    The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites,
    applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM
    or Kerberos in Credential Lockers.

- group: Credentials access from Web Browsers stores
  description: |
    Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browsers.
    Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need
    to be entered manually in the future. Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format
    within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.
