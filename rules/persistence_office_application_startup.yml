- group: Office Template Macros
  description: |
    Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain
    persistence on a compromised system. Microsoft Office contains
    templates that are part of common Office applications and are
    used to customize styles. The base templates within
    the application are used each time an application starts.
    Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros can be
    inserted into the base template and used to execute code
    when the respective Office application starts in order to
    obtain persistence. Examples for both Word and Excel have
    been discovered and published.
    By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created that
    can be modified to include a malicious macro.
    Excel does not have a template file created by default, but
    one can be added that will automatically be loaded. Shared
    templates may also be stored and pulled from remote locations.
