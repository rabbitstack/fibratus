- group: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder
  description: |
    Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup
    folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to
    the run keys in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program
    referenced to be executed when a user logs in. These programs will be
    executed under the context of the user and will have the account's
    associated permissions level.
