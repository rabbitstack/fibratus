  Identifies the execution of a suspicious Netsh Helper DLL. Adversaries may establish persistence 
  by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe is a command-line scripting 
  utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It supports the addition of 
  custom DLLs to extend its functionality that attackers can weaponize.
