description: |
  Adversaries may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes in order to
  evade process-based defenses. Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code
  in the address space of a separate live process.

  Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then
  unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code. A victim
  process can be created with native Windows API calls such as CreateProcess, which includes
  a flag to suspend the processes primary thread. At this point the process can be unmapped
  using APIs calls such as ZwUnmapViewOfSection or NtUnmapViewOfSection before being written
  to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory,
  SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread/ResumeProcess respectively.
