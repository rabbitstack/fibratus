name: LSASS memory dump preparation via SilentProcessExit
description: |
  Adversaries may exploit the SilentProcessExit debugging technique to conduct
  LSASS memory dump via WerFault.exe (Windows Error Reporting) binary by creating
  specific registry keys/values.
  WerFault.exe is a process known for dumping every crashing process. Attackers may
  exploit the WER service to evade defense mechanisms.
  This method relies on a mechanism introduced in Windows 7 called Silent Process Exit,
  which provides the ability to trigger specific actions for a monitored process
  either when process terminates itself by calling ExitProcess(), or another process
  terminates it via the TerminateProcess() API.
