name: AppDomain Manager injection via CLR search order hijacking
id: 9319fafd-b7dc-4d85-b41a-54a8d4f1ab18
version: 1.0.2
description: |
  Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking how the .NET AppDomainManager loads assemblies. 
  The .NET framework uses the AppDomainManager class to create and manage one or more isolated runtime environments 
  (called application domains) inside a process to host the execution of .NET applications. Assemblies may be loaded 
  into an application domain as executable code.
 
  Adversaries can abuse the CLR search order to load the malicious assembly from a writable directory by
  simply following the assembly file naming conventions and ensuring the .NET LOBIN is executed with the
  right environment variables set.
