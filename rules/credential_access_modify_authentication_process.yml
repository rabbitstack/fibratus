        Detects attempts to register malicious password filters to harvest credentials
        from local computers and/or entire domains. To perform proper validation,
        filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA. A malicious password
        filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.

        Detects possible credentials dumping or exfiltration via malicious password filter DLL.
        Adversaries can leverage the password filter DLL to intercept passwords in clear-text
        and exfiltrate them via C2 channels.
