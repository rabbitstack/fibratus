- group: LSASS memory
  description: |
    Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the
    process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).
    After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential
    materials in LSASS process memory. These credential materials can be harvested
    by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct Lateral Movement.

    - name: LSASS memory dump preparation via SilentProcessExit
      description: |
        Adversaries may exploit the SilentProcessExit debugging technique to conduct
        LSASS memory dump via WerFault.exe (Windows Error Reporting) binary by creating
        specific registry keys/values.
        WerFault.exe is a process known for dumping every crashing process.
        Attackers may exploit the WER service to evade defense mechanisms.
        This method relies on a mechanism introduced in Windows 7 called Silent Process Exit,
        which provides the ability to trigger specific actions for a monitored process
        either when process terminates itself by calling ExitProcess(), or another process
        terminates it via the TerminateProcess() API.
