Fibratus incorporates a framework for painlessly extending the functionality and incorporating new features via Python scripts. 
These scripts are called **filaments**. You can also think of them as extension points with virtually endless possibilities. 
Whatever you are allowed to craft in Python, you can also implement in filaments.

Visit the [documentation](https://www.fibratus.io/#/filaments/writing) for a walkthrough on writing a filament from scratch.

### Available filaments

- `fishy_netio` alerts when atypical processes produce network requests
- `top_in_packets` shows the top TCP / UDP inbound packets by IP/port tuple
- `top_keys` shows the top registry keys by number of registry operations
- `top_out_packets` shows the top TCP / UDP outbound packets by IP/port tuple
- `watch_files` watches files and directories created in the file system
- `teamviewer_remote_file_copy` identifies an executable or script file remotely downloaded via a TeamViewer transfer session
